Overview
--------

This is the README file for libunibreak, an implementation of the line
breaking and word breaking algorithms as described in Unicode
Standard Annex 14 and Unicode Standard Annex 30, available at
         <URL:http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-30.html>
         <URL:http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/tr29-17.html>

Licence
-------

This library is released under an open-source licence, the zlib/libpng
licence.  Please check the file LICENCE for details.

Apart from using the algorithm, part of the code is derived from the
data provided under
                  <URL:http://www.unicode.org/Public/>

And the Unicode Terms of Use may apply:

Installation
------------

There are three ways to build the library:

1) On *NIX systems supported by the autoconfiscation tools, do the
   normal

     ./configure
     make
     sudo make install

   to build and install both the dynamic and static libraries.  In
   addition, one may

   - type `make doc' to generate the doxygen documentation; or
   - type `make linebreakdata' to regenerate linebreakdata.c from
     LineBreak.txt.
   - type `make wordbreakdata' to regenerate wordbreakdata.c from
     WordBreakProperty.txt.

2) On systems where GCC and Binutils are supported, one can type

     cd src
     cp -p Makefile.gcc Makefile
     make

   to build the static library.  In addition, one may

   - type `make debug' or `make release' to explicitly generate the
     debug or release build;
   - type `make doc' to generate the doxygen documentation; or
   - type `make linebreakdata' to regenerate linebreakdata.c from
     LineBreak.txt.
   - type `make wordbreakdata' to regenerate wordbreakdata.c from
     WordBreakProperty.txt.

3) On Windows, apart from using method 1 (Cygwin/MSYS) and method 2
   (MinGW), MSVC can also be used.  Type

     cd src
     nmake -f Makefile.msvc

   to build the static library.  By default the debug release is built.
   To build the release version

     nmake -f Makefile.msvc CFG="libunibreak - Win32 Release"
