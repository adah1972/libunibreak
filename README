This is the README file for liblinebreak, an implementation of the line
breaking algorithm as described in Unicode 5.0.0 Standard Annex 14,
Revision 19, available at
         <URL:http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-19.html>

This library is released under an open-source licence, the zlib/libpng
licence.  Please check the file LICENCE for details.

Apart from using the algorithm, part of the code is derived from the
data provided under
                  <URL:http://www.unicode.org/Public/>

And the Unicode Terms of Use may apply:
              <URL:http://www.unicode.org/copyright.html>

This library is easy to build, and a Makefile is provided for the free
software environments.  Just type 'make', and it should work in most
cases.  I have tested only under Windows (MinGW and Cygwin).

- To generate the library (default to the debug build), type 'make'.
- To explicitly generate the debug or release build, type 'make debug'
  or 'make release'.
- To generate the doxygen documents, type 'make doc'.
- To regenerate linebreakdata.c from LineBreak.txt, type 'make
  linebreakdata'.

Check the generated document html/linebreak_8h.html for the public
interfaces exposed to applications.
